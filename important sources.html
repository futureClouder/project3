                <td>The article I chose was published by John A NaslundKelly A AschbrennerGregory J McHugoJürgen UnützerLisa A MarschStephen J Bartels 
                    in 2019 in Early Intervention in Psychiatry. the article titled " Exploring opportunities to support mental health care 
                    using social media: A survey of social media users with mental illness". This article is about the relevant psychological 
                    research. The researchers recruited volunteers using Twitter, which is a mainstream social networking platform. The authors
                    chose Twitter for this study because most of the users and the content they shared were publicly accessible, so that the 
                    researchers could know if the selected subjects were potentially mentally ill. Researchers used a questionnaire format to 
                    conduct the survey. The group of volunteers came from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Malaysia 
                    and other countries, with more than half of the volunteers coming from the United States. The volunteers were of a wide 
                    range of ages and had a high level of education overall. Participants' self-reported mental illness diagnoses did not 
                    differ between age groups. More than two-thirds of the sample reported a diagnosis of serious mental illness, mostly 
                    schizophrenia spectrum disorder; bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder. More than half of the participants 
                    reported being hospitalized at least once for a mental illness, and most reported experiencing moderate to very severe 
                    mental health symptoms that interfered with their daily activities. Through the survey, the researchers also found that 
                    these people enjoyed using social media such as Twitter, ins, and snapchat, and were interested in using social media for 
                    psychotherapy. Through their analysis, the researchers concluded that using social media to help people with mental illness
                    would cover more age groups and apply to more people, but not to the elderly population, who are less likely to publicly 
                    disclose their mental illness online and have little access to these social media platforms. The study also shed light on
                    the importance of social media for people with mental illness to access peer support. Researchers found that two-thirds of 
                    participants reported using social media to connect with others who have a mental illness, and more than 70 percent of 
                    participants used social media in this way at least once a week. More than half of the participants also reported using 
                    social media to share personal experiences about living with mental illness and to learn from others. According to previous
                    studies, access to illness experiences shared by other patients in online communities may be valuable in supporting illness
                    self-management.
