                <td>I think is the most important of the two is by Birnbaum, M. L., Rizvi, A. F., Correll, C. U. , & Kane, J. M. published
                    in 2017 in Early Intervention in Psychiatry, "Social media and the Internet in adolescents and young adults with 
                    psychotic disorders and non-psychotic mood disorders The Role of Care Pathways." I chose the first literature because 
                    it is a good illustration that digital technology and social media can be used to treat mental illness in young adults,
                    and that using social media to treat people with mental illness is not an empty, meaningless exercise, and is a good 
                    demonstration of the feasibility of the authors' ideas. The use of social media for psychotherapy is a clever case of 
                    combining traditional medicine with the Internet industry, a good attempt and in line with the times to benefit more 
                    people in an era where the Internet is advanced and the impact of the epidemic is far from fading. </td>

                <td><b>second important reference</b></td>
                <td>was published by Ferrari, A., Somerville, A., Baxter, A., Norman, R., Patten, S., Vos, T., and Whiteford, H. 
                    in Psychological Medicine in 2013, entitled " Global variation in the prevalence and incidence of major depressive 
                    disorder: A systematic review of the epidemiological literature." I chose the second article because it is a good 
                    illustration of what happens to people with major depressive disorder and trends for the future prevalence of this disorder.
                    Although it has been almost 10 years since this article was published, I think the data in it and the trends derived from 
                    it are still informative. In addition, although we know that many people are depressed to varying degrees, we do not know 
                    exactly how severe it is, and this article is a good way to show us how large the proportion of people suffering from 
                    depression is in today's world, and how likely it is that we or our friends are already suffering from depression or have a 
                    tendency to be depressed.</td>

                <td>is the one published by Greenwood, S., Perrin, A., and Duggan, M. in 2016 in Washington, DC: Pew Research Center. 
                    titled " Social media update 2016: Facebook usage and engagement is on the rise, while adoption of other platforms holds 
                    steady” This article focuses on the usage and user size of mainstream social media. We all know that the Internet has been 
                    around for many years and the related ecosystem has been gradually expanding, and social media, which is relevant to this 
                    article, is part and parcel of the Internet ecosystem. Although these social media have been born for many years, different
                    people hold different views. Some people believe that in mainstream countries and regions, social media have been widely 
                    used and become part of people's lives, and only some countries and regions, for some reasons, social media are not widely 
                    used by local people. Some people believe that social media is already widely used in all countries and regions of the world.
                    In addition, although we may think that social media has been widely used, we do not know how widely, and we do not know the
                    exact data. This article will be able to help us understand the relevant content.</td>

                <td><b>fourth important reference</b></td>
                <td>was published by Kessler, R. C., Amminger, G. P., Aguilar-Gaxiola, S., Alonso, J., Lee, S., & Ustun, T. B. in 2007 in
                    Current Opinion in Psychiatry. The article is titled " Age of onset of mental disorders: A review of recent literature". 
                    This article can be a good way to get us out of some misconceptions. I believe that many people would think that children 
                    or adolescents do not suffer from mental illness because at their age, the only thing they need to do is to study, attend 
                    class and complete their school assignments on time. Unlike adults, who have been exposed to the complexities of society 
                    and face various pressures, such as workplace pressures, family pressures, social pressures, etc., they only have academic 
                    pressures in their lives and are not exposed to society. At the same time, many people think that elderly people who have 
                    retired will not have mental illness because they are already retired and just need to rest and enjoy their lives for the 
                    rest of their lives. But the reality is not as rosy as we think. This article can help us to get out of the misunderstanding
                    and understand more deeply that all ages are made up of people who may suffer from mental illness, to support the background
                    of the article</td>

                <td><b>last important reference</b></td>
                <td>article was published by Naslund , JA, Aschbrenner, KA, & Bartels, SJ in Psychiatric Rehabilitation Journal in 2016. 
                    The title of the article is " How people living with serious mental illness use smartphones, mobile apps, and social 
                    media.”  I think this article is very important because it does a good job of telling us how people with mental illness 
                    use smartphones. We all know that people with mental illness have different daily habits and behaviors than those without
                    mental illness. Once we understand how these people use their smartphones, we can use their habits and behaviors to 
                    determine if social media for psychotherapy is feasible and how to develop an appropriate approach.</td>
