                    <td><b>Social Media</b></td>
                    <td>refers to the tools and platforms that people use to share their opinions, insights, experiences and 
                        views with each other on the Internet based on the content production and exchange platform of user 
                        relationships. Social media has flourished on the fertile ground of the Internet and exploded with 
                        dazzling energy. The information it disseminates has become an important part of people's browsing on the
                        Internet, not only creating one hot topic after another for people to discuss in their social life, but 
                        also attracting traditional media to follow. Social media should be the process of spontaneous contribution, 
                        extraction and creation of news and information by a large number of Internet users, and then dissemination. 
                        There are two points to emphasize, one is the large number of people and the other is the spontaneous 
                        dissemination, if any of these two factors are missing, it will not constitute the scope of social media.
                        The creation of social media relies on the development of WEB 2.0. If the network does not give Internet 
                        users more initiative, social media loses its mass base and technical support, and loses its foundation. 
                        If there is no technology to support so many interactive modes and so many interactive products, the 
                        demand of Internet users can only be suppressed and cannot be released. If there is no awareness of the 
                        Internet users for interactive, strong desire to express themselves will not give rise to so many dazzling
                        technology. Social media is based on the mass base and technical support to develop.

                        positive state, and can maintain normal regulation ability. In the practice of life, the individual has the basic

                        volitional mental activities. The common ones are affective mental disorders and organic mental disorders. There 
                        are many factors that contribute to the disorder: congenital genetics, personality traits and physical factors, 
                        organic factors, and social and environmental factors. Many patients with psychiatric disorders have delusions, 
                        hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, emotional disorders, erratic crying and laughing, self-talk, bizarre 
                        behavior, and reduced volition. Most patients lack self-awareness, do not admit that they are ill, and do not 
                        actively seek medical help. Common psychiatric disorders include: schizophrenia, manic-depressive psychosis, 
                        menopausal psychosis, paranoid psychosis and various organic pathologies accompanied by mental disorders</td>

                    <td><b>Bipolar disorder </b></td>
                    <td>is a common mental disorder with both manic episodes and depressive episodes (typical characteristics), and the 
                        first onset can be seen at any age. When manic episodes occur, patients show high emotion, increased verbal activity,
                        and high energy; while when depressive episodes occur, patients often show depressed mood, loss of pleasantness, 
                        decreased verbal activity, and fatigue and sluggishness. Its clinical manifestations are complex, and its complexity 
                        is reflected in the depressed or elevated mood, repeated, alternating, and irregular presentations accompanied by 
                        disorder symptoms such as distraction, rashness, exaggeration, racing thoughts, hyperreactivity, decreased sleep, and
                        increased speech. Anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and money abuse are also common, and psychotic 
                        symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, and high levels of mental stress may also occur. The etiology
                        is polymorphic and evolves in different ways, with episodic, cyclic, mixed migratory, and ebb-and-flow courses, 
                        such as 3 depressive phases followed by 2 manic phases. The intervals are either long or short, with relatively normal
                        social functioning during the intervals, but there will be functional damage to the brain, and after repeated episodes,
                        there will be a faster frequency of episodes and more complex disease.</td>

                    <td><b>Schizophrenia</b></td>
                    <td>is a group of chronic disorders of unknown etiology, most often with a slow or subacute onset in young adults, and often
                        manifests clinically as a syndrome of varying symptoms involving multiple impairments in perception, thinking, emotion, 
                        and behavior, as well as incoordination of mental activities. Patients are generally conscious and have normal intelligence, 
                        but some patients may develop cognitive impairment during the course of the disease. The course of the disease is generally 
                        prolonged, with recurrent episodes, exacerbations or deterioration, and some patients eventually experience decline and 
                        mental disability, but some patients can remain cured or largely cured after medication and psychotherapy. Although the 
                        etiology of schizophrenia is not well understood, there is consensus on the role of individual psychological susceptibility
                        and external social environment factors in the development of the disease. Both susceptibility qualities and external 
                        factors may contribute to the development of the disease through a combination of intrinsic biological factors, and a 
                        particular aspect of the disease may be more important in different patients. The clinical symptoms of schizophrenia are 
                        complex and varied, and may involve perception, thinking, emotion, volitional behavior, and cognitive function, etc. The 
                        symptoms vary greatly among individuals, and even the same patient may exhibit different symptoms at different stages or 
                        phases of the disease.</td>
